        "\n",
        "## The Challenge\n",
        "\n",
        "Leadership wants metrics! They need to see **standardized KPIs** across dashboards, reports, and Genie conversations. But you know the drill - every analyst has their own version of \"defect rate,\" and your team is drowning in inconsistent metric definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Note\n",
        "Use a SQL Warehouse to run this notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is Semantic Modeling?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Semantic modeling** creates a business-friendly layer on top of your data warehouse. Instead of writing SQL every time someone asks for \"average temperature\" or \"defect rate,\" you define these metrics once in a **metric view**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Metric Views** in Unity Catalog allow you to:\n",
        "- **Define metrics once**, use everywhere (dashboards, Genie, queries)\n",
        "- **Standardize calculations** so everyone uses the same logic\n",
        "- **Document relationships** between tables with semantic definitions\n",
        "- **Enable natural language queries** in Genie that understand your business terms\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it as creating a \"business dictionary\" that both humans and AI can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your Mission\n",
        "\n",
        "You have IOT sensor data from airplane parts manufactured in multiple factories. You need to define key metrics like:\n",
        "- Defect rates by factory and model\n",
        "- Average sensor readings (temperature, rotation speed, pressure)\n",
        "- Device counts and statuses\n",
        "- Time-based trends\n",

        "- **joins**: Define how to join with dimension tables (left joins to `dim_factories` and `dim_models`)\n",
        "- **dimensions**: Business-friendly names for grouping data (factory name, region, model category, etc.)\n",
        "- **measures**: Aggregated metrics (counts, averages, etc.)\n",
        "- **materialization**: Accelerates query performance by pre-computing aggregations (see below)\n",

        "- Genie to understand business terms like \"Factory Name\" and \"Average Temperature\"\n",

        "\n",
        "The `materialization` section in the metric view above enables **automatic query acceleration** using materialized views. This is a powerful feature that pre-computes common aggregations:\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "- **schedule**: Defines when materialized views refresh (e.g., `EVERY 6 HOURS`)\n",
        "- **mode**: Set to `relaxed` for automatic query rewriting without strict validation checks\n",
        "- **materialized_views**: List of pre-computed aggregations to maintain\n",
        "\n",
        "**Types of materializations:**\n",
        "1. **aggregated**: Pre-computes specific dimension/measure combinations for targeted performance\n",
        "   - Example: `defect_rate` by `factory_name` and `model_family`\n",
        "   - Best for common query patterns and dashboard widgets\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **unaggregated**: Materializes the full data model (source + joins + filters) for wider coverage\n",
        "   - Useful when your source is an expensive view or joins are costly\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query optimization:**\n",
        "When you query the metric view, Databricks automatically:\n",
        "- Uses pre-computed materializations when available (fast path)\n",
        "- Falls back to source data when needed (ensures queries always work)\n",
        "- Balances performance and data freshness transparently\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example from our metric view:**\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "materialization:\n",
        "  schedule: EVERY 6 HOURS\n",
        "  mode: relaxed\n",
        "  materialized_views:\n",
        "    - name: defect_rate_summary\n",
        "      type: aggregated\n",
        "      dimensions:\n",
        "        - factory_name\n",
        "        - model_family\n",

        "        - total_inspections\n",
        "```\n",

        "This configuration pre-computes defect rates grouped by factory and model family every 6 hours, dramatically speeding up dashboard queries that use these dimensions.\n",

        "- Databricks Runtime 17.2 or above\n",
        "\n",
        "**To verify if your query uses materialization:**\n",
        "- Run `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` on your query and look for `__materialization_mat___metric_view` in the plan\n",
        "- Or check the query profile in the SQL Editor\n",
        "\n",
        "**To create this in your environment:**\n",
        "1. Replace `{catalog_name}` with `workspace`\n",
        "2. Replace `{schema_name}` with your personal schema (extract username before @ symbol)\n",
        "   - Example: if your email is `jane.smith@company.com`, use `jane_smith`\n",
        "3. Run the SQL in a **SQL Warehouse** (metric views require SQL Warehouse, not compute clusters)\n",

        "-- They hardcoded the joins differently and got different results!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problems:**\n",
        "- ❌ Three different SQL queries for the \"same\" metric\n",

        "- ❌ Inconsistent results across reports\n",
