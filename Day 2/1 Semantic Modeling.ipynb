    "# Semantic Modeling with Metric Views\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Leadership wants metrics! They need to see **standardized KPIs** across dashboards, reports, and Genie conversations. But you know the drill - every analyst has their own version of \"defect rate,\" and your team is drowning in inconsistent metric definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Semantic Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic modeling** creates a business-friendly layer on top of your data warehouse. Instead of writing SQL every time someone asks for \"average temperature\" or \"defect rate,\" you define these metrics once in a **metric view**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metric Views** in Unity Catalog allow you to:\n",
    "- **Define metrics once**, use everywhere (dashboards, Genie, queries)\n",
    "- **Standardize calculations** so everyone uses the same logic\n",
    "- **Document relationships** between tables with semantic definitions\n",
    "- **Enable natural language queries** in Genie that understand your business terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as creating a \"business dictionary\" that both humans and AI can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You have IOT sensor data from airplane parts manufactured in multiple factories. You need to define key metrics like:\n",
    "- Defect rates by factory and model\n",
    "- Average sensor readings (temperature, rotation speed, pressure)\n",
    "- Device counts and statuses\n",
    "- Time-based trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of rebuilding everything from scratch, you'll follow Databricks' excellent hands-on demo and adapt it to your airplane IOT data.\n"

    "\n",
    "Follow along with the demo, but adapt it to **your airplane IOT data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Tables:**\n",
    "- `sensor_bronze` - Raw sensor readings (temperature, rotation_speed, air_pressure, etc.)\n",
    "- `inspection_bronze` / `inspection_gold` - Device inspection records with defects\n",
    "- `dim_factories` - Factory reference data (factory_name, region, city, state)\n",
    "- `dim_devices` - Device master data (links to factories and models)\n",
    "- `dim_models` - Aircraft part model information (model_family, model_category)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Metrics to Define:**\n",
    "1. **defect_rate** - Percentage of inspections with defects\n",
    "2. **avg_temperature** - Average temperature readings across devices\n",
    "3. **avg_rotation_speed** - Average rotation speed\n",
    "4. **device_count** - Count of active devices\n",
    "5. **total_inspections** - Count of all inspection records\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Dimensions:**\n",
    "- **factory_name** - Group metrics by factory\n",
    "- **region** - Aggregate by geographic region\n",
    "- **model_family** - Analyze by aircraft part model family\n",
    "- **date** - Time-based grouping from timestamps\n",
    "\n",

    "## What You've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've created your metric views following the demo, you've built a **semantic layer** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Defines standardized metrics (defect_rate, avg_temperature, etc.) that everyone uses consistently  \n",
    "✅ Documents business logic in code (not scattered across emails and wikis)  \n",
    "✅ Powers natural language queries in Genie - users can ask \"What's the defect rate by factory?\" and get accurate results  \n",
    "✅ Enables faster dashboard creation - designers can drag and drop pre-defined metrics  \n",
    "✅ Maintains data lineage - Unity Catalog tracks where each metric comes from  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your metric views are the **foundation** for the rest of the week:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Next: Dashboard Deep Dive** - You'll build executive dashboards using these standardized metrics\n",
    "- **Then: Genie Deep Dive** - These metrics enable Genie to answer complex business questions in natural language\n",
    "- **Later: Predictive Models** - Your clean metrics feed into ML models for anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The time you invest in semantic modeling pays off exponentially as your team builds on this foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:** Start simple! Define 3-5 key metrics that solve immediate pain points, then expand as you see value. Don't try to boil the ocean on day one.\n"

    "\n",
    "Want to go deeper with semantic modeling? Try these exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Create Time-Based Metrics**\n",
    "Define rolling averages and trends:\n",
    "- 7-day rolling average temperature\n",
    "- Month-over-month defect rate change\n",
    "- Peak usage hours by factory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Add Derived Dimensions**\n",
    "Create calculated dimensions like:\n",
    "- Device age buckets (0-1 year, 1-3 years, 3+ years)\n",
    "- Temperature categories (Normal, Warning, Critical)\n",
    "- Factory performance tiers based on defect rates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Build Multiple Metric Views**\n",
    "Create focused views for different use cases:\n",
    "- `factory_kpis` - Management dashboard metrics\n",
    "- `sensor_health` - Maintenance team metrics\n",
    "- `quality_metrics` - Quality assurance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Test in Genie**\n",
    "Go back to Genie and ask questions using your new metrics:\n",
    "- \"Show me the defect rate trend by model family for the last 30 days\"\n",
    "- \"Which factory has the highest average temperature?\"\n",
    "- \"Compare rotation speed across all regions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Document for Your Team**\n",
    "Add rich documentation to your metric views:\n",
    "- Business definitions for each metric\n",
    "- Calculation logic and assumptions\n",
    "- Data quality notes\n",
    "- Links to subject matter experts\n",
