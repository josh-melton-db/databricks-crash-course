    "\n",
    "We'll create a semantic layer for our IoT dataset that:\n",
    "- Defines standard metrics (avg temperature, device count, uptime %)\n",
    "- Creates reusable dimensions (factory, model, time)\n",
    "- Enables natural language queries\n",

    "\n",
    "### What are Metric Views?\n",
    "\n",
    "Metric views are Unity Catalog objects that define:\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Business KPIs (revenue, count, average)\n",
    "- **Dimensions**: Attributes for slicing data (time, location, category)\n",
    "- **Measures**: Base calculations for metrics\n",
    "- **Relationships**: How entities connect\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Layer Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Consistency**: One definition, used everywhere\n",
    "- **Discoverability**: Business users can find metrics easily\n",
    "- **Governance**: Control who can see and use metrics\n",
    "- **Performance**: Pre-aggregated and optimized\n",
    "- **Natural Language**: Query with plain English\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",

    "## 2. Using Databricks Assistant <a id=\"assistant\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI-Assisted Semantic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Databricks Assistant** can automatically generate metric view YAML definitions from natural language descriptions or existing tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the recommended approach** - let AI do the heavy lifting instead of manually typing YAML!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use the Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Open Catalog Explorer**\n",
    "1. Click **Catalog** in the sidebar\n",
    "2. Navigate to your schema: `default.db_crash_course`\n",
    "3. Click **Create** → **Metric View**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Use AI to Generate Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the metric view editor, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option A: Ask Assistant to Generate from Table**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: \"Create a metric view for the sensor_enriched table with metrics \n",
    "for average temperature, device count, and total readings. Include dimensions \n",
    "for factory, model, and date.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option B: Describe Your Business Metrics**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: \"I need a semantic model for IoT sensor analytics. \n",
    "Key metrics: average temperature by factory, device uptime percentage, \n",
    "anomaly rate. Dimensions: factory location, device model, time (daily/weekly).\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option C: Generate from Example Query**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prompt: \"Convert this SQL to a metric view:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "  factory_name,\n",
    "  AVG(temperature) as avg_temp,\n",
    "  COUNT(DISTINCT device_id) as device_count\n",
    "FROM sensor_enriched\n",
    "GROUP BY factory_name\n",
    "\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of AI Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Fast**: Generate complete YAML in seconds  \n",
    "✅ **Accurate**: Based on actual table schemas  \n",
    "✅ **Learning**: See best practices in generated code  \n",
    "✅ **Iterative**: Refine with follow-up prompts  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assistant Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be specific with:**\n",
    "- Table names and columns\n",
    "- Aggregation types (SUM, AVG, COUNT)\n",
    "- Dimension granularity\n",
    "- Business context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example good prompt:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Create a metric view for factory performance analysis using the \n",
    "sensor_enriched table. Include:\n",
    "- Metrics: average temperature (AVG), max temperature, device count (COUNT DISTINCT)\n",
    "- Dimensions: factory_name, region, model_category\n",
    "- Time dimension: by day from timestamp column\n",
    "- Calculate temperature_celsius = (temperature - 32) * 5/9 as a derived dimension\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Good Examples:**\n",
    "- `average_temperature_fahrenheit`\n",
    "- `total_sensor_readings`\n",
    "- `active_device_count`\n",
    "- `anomaly_detection_rate`\n",

    "- `total` (what total?)\n",
    "- `count` (count of what?)\n",
    "- `rate` (which rate?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Pre-Aggregated Tables**\n",
    "   - Create gold layer aggregates\n",
    "   - Point metric views to pre-aggregated data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partition Large Tables**\n",

    "     - name: sensors\n",
    "       sql_table: sensor_enriched\n",
    "       partition_columns: [reading_date]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Filters Early**\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   entities:\n",
    "     - name: recent_sensors\n",
    "       sql_table: sensor_enriched\n",
    "       filter: reading_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 90\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Governance\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Version Control**\n",
    "   - Store YAML in Git\n",
    "   - Use semantic versioning\n",
    "   - Document changes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Access Control**\n",
    "   - Grant appropriate permissions via Unity Catalog\n",
    "   - Limit write access to definitions\n",
