    "**The Scenario:** You've trained defect prediction models with AutoML and MLflow. Now leadership needs these models in production - scoring thousands of devices in batch, monitoring sensors in real-time streams, and serving predictions via APIs.\n",

    "- **Batch Inference** - Score large datasets all at once\n",
    "- **Streaming Inference** - Real-time predictions on streaming data\n",
    "- **Model Serving APIs** - REST endpoints for applications\n",
