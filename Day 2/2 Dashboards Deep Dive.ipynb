    "## 1. Query-Based Parameters <a id=\"parameters\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters make dashboards dynamic - users can filter and customize views without editing queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Static Parameters** - Fixed list of values\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Define parameter: factory_filter\n",
    "-- Type: Dropdown\n",
    "-- Values: [\"All\", \"TechHub Seattle\", \"Innovation Austin\", \"CloudForge Portland\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM sensor_enriched\n",
    "WHERE factory_name = '{{factory_filter}}'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Query-Based Parameters** - Dynamic values from a query\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Parameter query to populate dropdown:\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT factory_name \n",
    "FROM sensor_enriched \n",
    "ORDER BY factory_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Date Range Parameters**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM sensor_enriched\n",
    "WHERE DATE(timestamp) BETWEEN '{{start_date}}' AND '{{end_date}}'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Create Parameter Query**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Query: get_factories\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT factory_name, factory_name as label\n",
    "FROM default.db_crash_course.sensor_enriched\n",
    "ORDER BY factory_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Use in Main Query**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Query: factory_metrics\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "  factory_name,\n",
    "  COUNT(DISTINCT device_id) as device_count,\n",
    "  AVG(temperature) as avg_temp,\n",

    "FROM default.db_crash_course.sensor_enriched\n",
    "WHERE factory_name = '{{factory_parameter}}'\n",
    "  AND DATE(timestamp) >= '{{start_date}}'\n",
    "GROUP BY factory_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Link Parameter to Query**\n",
    "- In query editor, add parameter widget\n",
    "- Select \"Query-based\"\n",
    "- Choose parameter query\n",
    "- Set default value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use query-based parameters** for dynamic lists  \n",
    "✅ **Add \"All\" option** when appropriate  \n",
    "✅ **Set sensible defaults** (e.g., last 30 days)  \n",
    "✅ **Label parameters clearly** for end users  \n",
    "✅ **Test edge cases** (empty results, null values)\n"
