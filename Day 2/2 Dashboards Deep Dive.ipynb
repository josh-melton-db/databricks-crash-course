    "2. **Linked visualizations** - Charts that respond to filter selections\n",
    "3. **Metric view integration** - Leverage your semantic model for consistent metrics\n",

    "**Why this matters:** You'll build on the foundation from yesterday, adding parameters and filters that make the dashboard dynamic. This is how you transform a static report into an interactive analytics tool.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** Imagine an executive viewing a high-level chart showing defect rates by model. With drill-through, they can click on \"Model A\" and instantly navigate to a detailed page showing all inspections, sensor readings, and quality metrics for just that model—without manually setting filters.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Drill-Through Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pattern:**\n",
    "1. **Source visualization** - A chart on your overview page (e.g., defect rates by model)\n",
    "2. **Target page** - A detailed page with visualizations based on the same dataset\n",
    "3. **Automatic filtering** - When a user clicks a data segment, the target page opens with all compatible visualizations automatically filtered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supported chart types for drill-through:**\n",
    "- Bar charts\n",
    "- Box plots\n",
    "- Heatmaps\n",
    "- Histograms\n",
    "- Pie charts\n",
    "- Scatter plots\n",
    "- Point maps\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up Drill-Through\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Both the source chart and target page visualizations must use the same dataset\n",
    "- Matching data types (numeric-to-numeric, categorical-to-dropdown, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create your overview page** with a source chart\n",
    "   - Example: Bar chart showing `AVG(avg_defect_rate)` by `model_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a detail page** with multiple visualizations\n",
    "   - Example: Time series of temperature, scatter plot of rotation speed, table of inspections\n",
    "   - All based on the same dataset as your source chart\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enable drill-through:**\n",
    "   - Go back to your overview page\n",
    "   - Right-click on a data segment in your source chart (e.g., a specific bar)\n",
    "   - Select **\"Drill to\"** from the context menu\n",
    "   - Choose your target detail page\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test it:**\n",
    "   - Click on different data points in your source chart\n",
    "   - Watch as the detail page opens with automatic filtering applied!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Keep datasets consistent** - Source and target must use the same dataset for auto-filtering to work  \n",
    "✅ **Design for exploration** - Overview pages show high-level trends, detail pages show comprehensive metrics  \n",
    "✅ **Add breadcrumbs** - Include a \"Back to Overview\" button or text box on detail pages  \n",
    "✅ **Test thoroughly** - Click different data points to ensure filtering works as expected  \n",
