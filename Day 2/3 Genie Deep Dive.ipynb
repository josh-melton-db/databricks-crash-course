    "# Genie Deep Dive: Making Your Semantic Model Conversational\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've created a semantic model with metric views, it's time to make it conversational with Genie. Leadership wants you to enable natural language queries so anyone can ask questions about the IoT data without writing SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Create a Genie Space for your semantic model  \n",
    "✅ Add instructions to guide query generation  \n",
    "✅ Define filters for common questions  \n",
    "✅ Test with a benchmark query  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your semantic model (`iot_sensor_metrics`) is ready, but the operations team doesn't know SQL. They need to ask questions like:\n",
    "- \"What's the average temperature in the West region?\"\n",
    "- \"Show me devices with high anomaly rates\"\n",
    "- \"Which factory has the most critical readings?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Genie will translate these natural language questions into queries against your semantic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Genie?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genie** is Databricks' AI-powered natural language interface for querying data. It uses your semantic model and additional context to generate accurate SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components for This Exercise:**\n",
    "- **Genie Space**: Container pointing to your metric view\n",
    "- **Instructions**: Business context and terminology\n",
    "- **Filters**: Pre-defined query shortcuts\n",
    "- **Benchmark**: Test question to verify accuracy\n",

    "### Setup in the UI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigate to Genie:**\n",
    "1. Click **Genie** in the sidebar\n",
    "2. Click **Create Space**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add Your Semantic Model:**\n",
    "- Select `default.db_crash_course.iot_sensor_metrics` (the metric view you created in notebook 1)\n",
    "- Optionally add `dim_factories` if you need factory details beyond what's in the metric view\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use the metric view?**\n",
    "- ✅ Pre-defined metrics are already understood by Genie\n",
    "- ✅ Consistent business logic\n",

    "- ✅ Better accuracy (clear metric definitions)\n",

    "## Step 2: Add Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Instructions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions** teach Genie about your business context and terminology. They're shown to Genie when generating queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Genie Space, click **Instructions** and add this context:\n",

    "```\n",
    "## IoT Sensor Data Context\n",
    "\n",
    "You are helping analyze data from aircraft sensors deployed across factories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Metrics (from iot_sensor_metrics)\n",
    "- average_temperature: Average temperature in Fahrenheit across sensors\n",
    "- total_sensor_readings: Total count of all sensor readings\n",
    "- active_devices: Number of distinct devices reporting data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensions\n",
    "- factory_name: Name of the factory location\n",
    "- region: Geographic region (West, East, Central, International)\n",
    "- model_category: Aircraft model category\n",
    "- reading_date: Date of sensor reading\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Rules\n",
    "- Critical threshold: Temperature > 85°F\n",
    "- Normal operating range: 60-75°F\n",
    "- Operating hours: 6 AM - 10 PM daily\n",
    "\n",
    "### Join Keys\n",
    "- factory_id: Connects to dim_factories table for additional factory details\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this helps:**\n",
    "- ✅ Genie understands your metric definitions\n",
    "- ✅ Knows what thresholds matter\n",
    "- ✅ Can join to related tables when needed\n",
    "- ✅ Generates more accurate queries\n",

    "\n",

    "**Time Filter:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name: Last 7 Days\n",
    "Description: Data from the past week\n",
    "SQL: reading_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 7\n",

    "Name: Critical Temperatures\n",
    "Description: Readings above critical threshold\n",
    "SQL: average_temperature > 85\n",
    "```\n",

    "- \"Show me average temperature for **West Region**\"\n",
    "- \"What's the device count in the **Last 7 Days**?\"\n",
    "- \"Count **Critical Temperatures** by factory\"\n",
