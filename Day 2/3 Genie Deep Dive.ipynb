    "# Genie Deep Dive: Making Your Semantic Model Conversational\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've created a semantic model with metric views, it's time to make it conversational with Genie. Leadership wants you to enable natural language queries so anyone can ask questions about the IoT data without writing SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Create a Genie Space for your semantic model  \n",
    "✅ Add instructions to guide query generation  \n",
    "✅ Define filters for common questions  \n",
    "✅ Test with a benchmark query  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your semantic model (`iot_sensor_metrics`) is ready, but the operations team doesn't know SQL. They need to ask questions like:\n",
    "- \"What's the average temperature in the West region?\"\n",
    "- \"Show me devices with high anomaly rates\"\n",
    "- \"Which factory has the most critical readings?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Genie will translate these natural language questions into queries against your semantic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Genie?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genie** is Databricks' AI-powered natural language interface for querying data. It uses your semantic model and additional context to generate accurate SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components for This Exercise:**\n",
    "- **Genie Space**: Container pointing to your metric view\n",
    "- **Instructions**: Business context and terminology\n",
    "- **Filters**: Pre-defined query shortcuts\n",
    "- **Benchmark**: Test question to verify accuracy\n",

    "## Step 1: Create Your Genie Space  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup in the UI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a Semantic Model Genie:**\n",
    "1. Click **Genie** in the sidebar\n",
    "2. Click **New**\n",
    "3. Select **Metric views**\n",
    "4. Select `dwx_airops_insights_platform_dev_workspace.{username}.iot_sensor_metrics` (the metric view you created in notebook 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use the metric view?**\n",
    "- ✅ Pre-defined metrics are already understood by Genie\n",
    "- ✅ Consistent business logic\n",
    "- ✅ Faster queries (uses aggregated data)\n",
    "- ✅ Better accuracy (clear metric definitions)\n",

    "- ✅ Generates more accurate queries\n",
