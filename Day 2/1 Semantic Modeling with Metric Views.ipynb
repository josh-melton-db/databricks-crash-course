        "\n",
        "You have sensor data streaming from planes across multiple factories, inspection records, and anomaly detections. Business users want to ask questions like:\n",
        "- \"What's our average temperature by factory this month?\"\n",
        "- \"Show me defect rates by model family\"\n",
        "- \"Which devices are running hot?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Problem:** Every dashboard, every Genie Space, every analyst is writing the same metric definitions differently:\n",
        "- One person calculates `defect_rate` as `SUM(defects)/COUNT(*)`\n",
        "- Another uses `AVG(CASE WHEN defect=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`\n",
        "- Results don't match. Trust is lost. Deadlines slip.\n",

        "\n",
        "A **semantic layer** is a business-friendly abstraction over your raw data that:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Defines metrics consistently** - One source of truth for \"defect_rate\", \"avg_temperature\", etc.\n",
        "2. **Powers everything** - Dashboards, Genie, BI tools, and AI agents all consume the same definitions\n",
        "3. **Enables self-service** - Business users can explore without writing SQL\n",
        "4. **Ensures governance** - Metrics are documented, versioned, and controlled\n",

        "- **Entities**: Your core tables (e.g., `sensor_bronze`, `dim_devices`)\n",
        "- **Measures**: Aggregations (e.g., `AVG(temperature)`, `COUNT(device_id)`)\n",
        "- **Dimensions**: How to slice data (e.g., by factory, by model, by time)\n",
        "- **Metrics**: Business KPIs composed from measures (e.g., `defect_rate`, `anomaly_percentage`)\n",
        "\n",
        "Once defined, these metrics can be queried in:\n",
        "- SQL: `SELECT * FROM metric_view WHERE factory='A06'`\n",
