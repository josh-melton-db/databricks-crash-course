    "# Data Transformation: Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Situation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your leadership team just dropped a bombshell: they want dashboards, interactive \"talk to my data\" capabilities, predictive maintenance models, and AI agent systems - **all by the end of the week**. Your IoT sensors on planes are generating massive amounts of data, and you need to get it production-ready, fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: Databricks has **Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines** that can help you build reliable, production-ready data pipelines in minutes, not days.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ What declarative pipelines are and why they matter  \n",
    "✅ Create a streaming table to ingest and clean sensor data  \n",
    "✅ Create a materialized view for aggregated metrics  \n",

    "## What are Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines (formerly Delta Live Tables) is a framework for building reliable, production-ready data pipelines. Instead of writing complex code to manage checkpoints, handle incremental processing, and track data quality, you simply declare **what** you want using either SQL or Python. The framework automatically handles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Incremental processing** - Only process new/changed data\n",
    "- ✅ **Dependency management** - Determine execution order automatically\n",
    "- ✅ **Data quality** - Built-in validation with expectations\n",
    "- ✅ **Monitoring** - Automatic lineage and observability\n",
    "- ✅ **Recovery** - Checkpoint management and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Key Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Streaming Tables**\n",
    "- For incremental, append-only data processing\n",
    "- Perfect for ingesting raw sensor data and cleaning it\n",
    "- Uses Auto Loader to automatically discover new files\n",
    "- Each row processed exactly once (exactly-once semantics)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Materialized Views**\n",
    "- For aggregations that need to update (not just append)\n",
    "- Perfect for business metrics and KPIs\n",
    "- Always return correct, up-to-date results\n",
    "- Automatically recompute when source data changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### About This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to create and deploy an ETL (extract, transform, and load) pipeline for data orchestration using Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines and Auto Loader. You will use pipelines to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ingest raw sensor data from a volume into a streaming table\n",
    "- Transform and validate the data with data quality expectations\n",
    "- Create aggregated views for dashboards and analytics\n",
    "- Perform ad-hoc queries on the processed data\n",
    "- Automate the ETL pipeline with a scheduled job\n",

    "## Step 1: Create Your Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to create a new Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your workspace, click **New** (Plus icon) in the sidebar, then select **ETL Pipeline**.\n",
    "2. Give your pipeline a unique name: `IoT Sensor Pipeline`\n",
    "3. Just below the name, select the default catalog and schema for the data that you generate:\n",
    "   - **Catalog:** `dwx_airops_insights_platform_dev_working`\n",
    "   - **Schema:** Your personal schema (should look like `jane_doe` - your username with special characters replaced with underscores)\n",
    "   - Note: You must have `ALL PRIVILEGES` or `USE CATALOG` and `CREATE SCHEMA` permissions\n",
    "4. For this tutorial, select **Start with an empty file**.\n",
    "5. In **Folder path**, specify a location for your source files, or accept the default (your user folder).\n",
    "6. Choose **Python** or **SQL** as the language for your first source file (a pipeline can mix and match languages, but each file must be in a single language).\n",
    "7. Click **Select**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline editor appears for the new pipeline. An empty source file for your language is created, ready for your first transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll See\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Lakeflow Pipelines Editor** has three main components:\n",
    "- **Left panel**: Code editor where you write your pipeline logic\n",
    "- **Right panel**: Pipeline graph (DAG) showing your data flow\n",
    "- **Bottom panel**: Table preview and data results\n",
    "\n",

    "### Schedule Your Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top of the editor, choose the **Schedule** button.\n",
    "2. If the **Schedules** dialog appears, choose **Add schedule**.\n",
    "3. This opens the **New schedule** dialog, where you can create a job to run your pipeline on a schedule.\n",
    "4. Optionally, give the job a name: `IoT Sensor Pipeline - Daily Update`\n",
    "5. By default, the schedule is set to run once per day. You can accept this default, or set your own schedule:\n",
    "   - Choosing **Advanced** gives you the option to set a specific time that the job will run\n",
    "   - Selecting **More options** allows you to create notifications when the job runs\n",
    "6. Select **Create** to apply the changes and create the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the job will run daily to keep your pipeline up to date. You can choose **Schedule** again to view the list of schedules. You can manage schedules for your pipeline from that dialog, including adding, editing, or removing schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking the name of the schedule (or job) takes you to the job's page in the **Jobs & pipelines** list. From there you can view details about job runs, including the history of runs, or run the job immediately with the **Run now** button.\n",

    "### 1. Add Device-Level Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Create another materialized view for per-device KPIs to track individual device health.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. In your pipeline editor, add the following code to your source file (or create a new source file)\n",
    "2. Click Play icon **Run file** to update the pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dp.materialized_view(name=\"device_health_gold\")\n",
    "def device_health_gold():\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        spark.read.table(\"sensor_silver\")\n",
    "        .groupBy(\"device_id\", \"factory_id\")\n",
    "        .agg(\n",
    "            avg(\"temperature\").alias(\"avg_temp\"),\n",
    "            count(\"*\").alias(\"reading_count\")\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW device_health_gold\n",
    "AS SELECT \n",
    "  device_id,\n",
    "  factory_id,\n",
    "  AVG(temperature) as avg_temp,\n",
    "  COUNT(*) as reading_count\n",
    "FROM sensor_silver\n",
    "GROUP BY device_id, factory_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline graph will update to show three nodes: `sensor_silver` → `factory_kpis_gold` and `device_health_gold`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Add Inspection Data Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a parallel streaming table for inspection records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. From the pipeline assets browser, click Plus icon **Add** then **Source**\n",
    "2. Choose your language (Python or SQL)\n",
    "3. Paste the code below\n",
    "4. Click Play icon **Run file**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dp.table(name=\"inspection_silver\")\n",
    "def inspection_silver():\n",
    "    return (\n",

    "        .load(\"/Volumes/dwx_airops_insights_platform_dev_working/db_crash_course/inspection_data/\")\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE inspection_silver\n",
    "AS SELECT *\n",
    "FROM STREAM read_files(\n",

    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Organize with Multiple Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the multi-file editor to organize your pipeline by layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Click Plus icon **Add** then **Source** to create new files\n",
    "2. Name them: `bronze_layer.py`, `silver_layer.py`, `gold_layer.py`\n",
    "3. Move related code to each file\n",
    "4. Run Play icon **Run pipeline** to process all files together\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Better organization\n",
    "- Easier collaboration\n",
    "- Clear separation of concerns\n",
    "- All files in the `transformations` folder are processed together\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Create More Exploration Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice ad-hoc queries with additional exploration notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideas:**\n",
    "- **Data Quality Report**: Check for data issues and anomalies\n",
    "- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze sensor performance trends\n",
    "- **Factory Comparison**: Compare metrics across regions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Click Plus icon **Add** then **Exploration**\n",
    "2. Name your notebook\n",
    "3. Write SQL queries to analyze your data\n",
    "4. These don't affect the pipeline, only for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Explore Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Change Data Capture (CDC)** - Handle updates and deletes\n",
    "- **Watermarks** - Handle late-arriving data\n",
    "- **Flows** - Multiple sources writing to one table\n",
    "- **Expectations with actions** - Drop or quarantine bad data\n",
