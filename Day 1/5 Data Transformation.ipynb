    "# Data Transformation: Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Situation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your leadership team just dropped a bombshell: they want dashboards, interactive \"talk to my data\" capabilities, predictive maintenance models, and AI agent systems - **all by the end of the week**. Your IoT sensors on planes are generating massive amounts of data, and you need to get it production-ready, fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: Databricks has **Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines** (formerly Delta Live Tables) that can help you build reliable, production-ready data pipelines in minutes, not days.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ What declarative pipelines are and why they matter  \n",
    "✅ Create a streaming table to ingest and clean sensor data  \n",
    "✅ Create a materialized view for aggregated metrics  \n",
    "✅ Deploy your pipeline to production  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Time to Complete:** 20-30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Declarative Pipelines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing complex code to manage checkpoints, handle incremental processing, and track data quality, you simply declare **what** you want. The framework automatically handles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Incremental processing** - Only process new/changed data\n",
    "- ✅ **Dependency management** - Determine execution order automatically\n",
    "- ✅ **Data quality** - Built-in validation with expectations\n",
    "- ✅ **Monitoring** - Automatic lineage and observability\n",
    "- ✅ **Recovery** - Checkpoint management and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Key Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Streaming Tables**\n",
    "- For incremental, append-only data processing\n",
    "- Perfect for ingesting raw sensor data and cleaning it\n",
    "- Each row processed exactly once\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Materialized Views**\n",
    "- For aggregations that need to update (not just append)\n",
    "- Perfect for business metrics and KPIs\n",
    "- Always return correct, up-to-date results\n",

    "   - **Target Schema:** `db_crash_course`\n",
    "   - **Language:** Choose Python or SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Paste your code:**\n",
    "   - Copy the complete Python or SQL code from the next cell\n",
    "   - Paste into the pipeline editor\n",
    "   - The editor will show you a visual graph of your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configure pipeline settings:**\n",
    "   - **Mode:** \n",
    "     - `Triggered` - Runs on schedule or manual trigger (good for learning)\n",
    "     - `Continuous` - Always running, processes data immediately (production)\n",
    "   - **Cluster:** Accept defaults (auto-scaling recommended)\n",

    "5. **Start the pipeline:**\n",
    "   - Click `Start`\n",
    "   - Monitor progress in the pipeline graph\n",
    "   - View data quality metrics in real-time\n",
    "   - Check expectation violations in the dashboard\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 **Congratulations!** You've built a production-ready data pipeline with:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Streaming table** - Automatically ingests and cleans sensor data  \n",
    "✅ **Data quality** - Tracks and enforces expectations  \n",
    "✅ **Materialized view** - Always-current factory KPIs  \n",
    "✅ **Deployment** - Running in production with monitoring  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Get For Free\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework automatically provides:\n",
    "- ✅ Incremental processing (only new data)\n",
    "- ✅ Checkpoint management (exactly-once guarantees)\n",
    "- ✅ Schema evolution (handles new columns gracefully)\n",
    "- ✅ Data quality tracking (expectations dashboard)\n",
    "- ✅ Lineage visualization (see data flow)\n",
    "- ✅ Error recovery (automatic retries)\n",
    "- ✅ Monitoring (performance and health metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for Your Week\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have clean, aggregated data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dashboards** - Use `factory_kpis_gold` for visualizations\n",
    "2. **Genie** - Connect to `sensor_silver` for natural language queries\n",
    "3. **AutoML** - Use `sensor_silver` for predictive maintenance models\n",
    "4. **Agents** - Build on clean data for AI systems\n",
    "\n",
    "You're well on your way to meeting leadership's deadline! 🚀"

    "## Try This Out: Extend Your Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to learn more? Here are some ideas to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Add a Bronze Layer\n",
    "Create a raw ingestion table before cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dp.table(name=\"sensor_bronze\")\n",
    "def sensor_bronze():\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        spark.readStream\n",
    "        .format(\"cloudFiles\")\n",
    "        .option(\"cloudFiles.format\", \"csv\")\n",
    "        .option(\"header\", \"true\")\n",
    "        .load(\"/Volumes/default/db_crash_course/sensor_data/\")\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "# Then update sensor_silver to read from sensor_bronze\n",
    "@dp.table(name=\"sensor_silver\")\n",
    "def sensor_silver():\n",
    "    return dp.read_stream(\"sensor_bronze\").withColumn(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Add Device-Level Metrics\n",
    "Create another materialized view for per-device KPIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dp.materialized_view(name=\"device_health_gold\")\n",
    "def device_health_gold():\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        spark.read.table(\"sensor_silver\")\n",
    "        .groupBy(\"device_id\", \"factory_id\")\n",
    "        .agg(\n",
    "            avg(\"temperature\").alias(\"avg_temp\"),\n",
    "            count(\"*\").alias(\"reading_count\")\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Add Inspection Data\n",
    "Create a parallel streaming table for inspection records:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dp.table(name=\"inspection_silver\")\n",
    "def inspection_silver():\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        spark.readStream\n",
    "        .format(\"cloudFiles\")\n",
    "        .option(\"cloudFiles.format\", \"csv\")\n",
    "        .option(\"header\", \"true\")\n",
    "        .load(\"/Volumes/default/db_crash_course/inspection_data/\")\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Explore Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flows** - Multiple sources writing to one table\n",
    "- **CDC** - Handle change data capture\n",
    "- **Watermarks** - Handle late-arriving data\n",
    "- **Multi-file organization** - Separate bronze/silver/gold into different files\n",
