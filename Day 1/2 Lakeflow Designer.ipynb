    "# Lakeflow Designer: Visual Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lakeflow Designer** is a low-code, drag-and-drop interface for building queries and data transformations. It's built to be an AI-native experience, leveraging the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to provide accurate AI-generated transformations.\n",

    "## What is Lakeflow Designer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Designer enables self-service business analytics through:\n",
    "- **Visual workflow canvas** - Drag-and-drop nodes to build transformations\n",
    "- **AI-assisted transformations** - Use natural language to describe what you want\n",
    "- **SQL generation** - Everything generates underlying SQL that can be stored in Git\n",
    "- **Unity Catalog integration** - Read from and write to UC tables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No-code/Low-code** - Build transformations without writing SQL (but you can if you want!)\n",
    "- **AI-native** - Use the Assistant to generate transformations via natural language\n",
    "- **Git-friendly** - Output is SQL that can be version controlled\n",
    "- **Real-time preview** - See results as you build\n",
