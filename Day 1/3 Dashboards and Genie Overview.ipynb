    "### Try These Questions in Your Genie Space:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your Genie Space is set up, try asking these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"How many devices do we have?\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will count distinct devices\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"What is the average temperature?\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will aggregate sensor readings\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"Show me all factories\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will query the factories dimension table\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intermediate Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **\"What is the average temperature by factory?\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will join sensors with factories and group by\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **\"Which device has the most anomalies?\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will query anomaly_detected and rank devices\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **\"Show me defect rate by model category\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will calculate defect percentages grouped by category\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **\"Show me the trend in average temperature over time\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will create a line chart of temperature trends\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **\"Which factories have the highest defect rates and show me their locations?\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will join multiple tables and sort results\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **\"Compare rotation speed between SkyJet and EcoJet models\"**\n",
    "   - Genie will filter and compare model families\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **\"What percentage of readings are anomalies?\"**\n",
    "    - Genie will calculate the ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Better Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Be specific** - Include table names, column names if Genie struggles  \n",
    "✅ **Use business terms** - Reference the terms you defined  \n",
    "✅ **Ask follow-ups** - Refine your question based on results  \n",
    "✅ **Request visualizations** - \"Show me as a bar chart\"  \n",
    "✅ **Provide context** - \"In the last 30 days...\" or \"For factory A06...\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Genie Conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**User:** \"What is the average temperature by factory?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genie:** [Generates query, shows bar chart with avg temp per factory]\n",
