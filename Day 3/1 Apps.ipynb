    "# Databricks Apps: Deploy a Web Application\n",
    "\n",
    "You've built data pipelines, created dashboards, and enabled natural language queries with Genie. Now it's time to create a custom web application that brings everything together in a user-friendly interface!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Understand what Databricks Apps are  \n",
    "✅ Prepare your app files for deployment  \n",
    "✅ Deploy a web app using the Databricks UI  \n",
    "✅ Access and share your deployed app  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Your IoT data platform is complete with pipelines, dashboards, and Genie. But the operations team wants a **custom real-time monitoring interface** to track aircraft sensors on a map with live updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of building separate infrastructure, you'll deploy this as a **Databricks App** - a fully managed web application that runs directly in your Databricks workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Databricks Apps?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Databricks Apps** let you deploy custom web applications directly in your Databricks workspace. These can be:\n",
    "- Interactive dashboards with real-time data\n",
    "- Data exploration tools\n",
    "- ML model interfaces\n",
    "- Custom business applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- ✅ **No infrastructure management** - Databricks handles hosting, scaling, and maintenance\n",
    "- ✅ **Integrated with Unity Catalog** - Direct access to your data\n",
    "- ✅ **Built-in security** - Uses Databricks authentication and permissions\n",
    "- ✅ **Multiple frameworks supported** - Python (Flask, Dash, Streamlit) or Node.js (Express, React)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our App: Aircraft Sensor Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "The app in the `Day 3/App` folder is a real-time aircraft monitoring dashboard that shows:\n",
    "- **Interactive map** tracking aircraft positions\n",
    "- **Live sensor data** for temperature, pressure, speed\n",
    "- **Historical charts** showing trends over time\n",

    "\n",
    "## What's in the App Folder?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Day 3/App` folder in this repo contains a Node.js web application:\n",

    "- **`server.js`** - Express backend serving API endpoints and static files\n",
    "- **`package.json`** - Dependencies (Express) and start command\n",
    "- **`static/`** folder - HTML and JavaScript for the dashboard UI\n",
    "\n",
    "When deployed, Databricks automatically detects the Node.js app, installs dependencies, and runs it.\n",
