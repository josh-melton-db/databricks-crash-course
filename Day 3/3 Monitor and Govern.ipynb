    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've learned how to monitor and govern your Databricks workspace using system tables and Unity Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Created synthetic system tables** - Billing, query history, audit logs  \n",
    "✅ **Analyzed costs** - By workspace, user, SKU type, and time  \n",
    "✅ **Monitored usage** - Query patterns, performance, and user activity  \n",
    "✅ **Implemented security** - Row filters, column masking, access control  \n",
    "✅ **Built audit trails** - Track data access and schema changes  \n",
    "✅ **Designed dashboards** - Visual cost tracking and governance  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monitor costs regularly** - Set up daily/weekly reviews\n",
    "2. **Implement cost allocation** - Tag and track by team/project\n",
    "3. **Use row-level security** - Protect sensitive data automatically\n",
    "4. **Audit access** - Track who accesses what and when\n",
    "5. **Create dashboards** - Visualize key metrics for stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying This to the IoT Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For your IoT manufacturing project, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Monitoring:**\n",
    "- Track costs of your daily sensor data pipelines\n",
    "- Monitor dashboard query costs from Genie spaces\n",
    "- Allocate costs to different teams (ops, analytics, ML)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Governance:**\n",
    "- Ensure analysts only access authorized factory data\n",
    "- Mask device IDs for non-admin users\n",
    "- Monitor which ML models are consuming resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security & Compliance:**\n",
    "- Restrict regional data access based on user location\n",
    "- Audit access to sensitive inspection data\n",
    "- Track schema changes to production tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Optimization Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use job clusters** instead of all-purpose for scheduled workloads\n",
    "- **Enable auto-termination** on interactive clusters (15-30 minutes)\n",
    "- **Right-size clusters** - Don't over-provision compute\n",
    "- **Use spot instances** where possible for non-critical jobs\n",
    "- **Schedule non-urgent jobs** for off-peak hours\n",
    "- **Archive old data** to cheaper storage tiers\n",
    "- **Use Photon** for SQL queries (2-3x performance improvement)\n",
    "- **Enable Predictive Optimization** for automatic table maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a governance dashboard** using the queries above\n",
    "2. **Set up alerts** for cost thresholds and unusual access patterns\n",
    "3. **Implement row-level security** on your IoT tables\n",
    "4. **Review audit logs** weekly to track usage patterns\n",
    "5. **Share cost reports** with leadership to demonstrate value\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Try This Out\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** Create a comprehensive governance dashboard for the IoT project with:\n",
    "1. Cost by factory (join billing data with job metadata)\n",
    "2. Most queried IoT tables (from query_history)\n",
    "3. User access patterns (from audit_logs)\n",
    "4. Failed query analysis (for troubleshooting)\n",
