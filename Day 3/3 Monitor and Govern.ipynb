The SQL queries below use `{CATALOG}.{WRITE_SCHEMA}` placeholders that you'll need to replace with your actual catalog and schema.\n\n**For SQL cells below**: Replace `{CATALOG}.{WRITE_SCHEMA}` with your values from the configuration cell above.\n- Example: If WRITE_SCHEMA is `jane_smith_company_com`, use `dwx_airops_insights_platform_dev_workspace.jane_smith_company_com`\n\n**Or convert to Python**: Use `spark.sql(f\"SELECT ...
