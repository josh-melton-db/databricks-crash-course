    "## Advanced Security Features (Illustrative Examples - Do Not Run)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unity Catalog supports advanced security features for fine-grained access control. The examples below are **for reference only** to illustrate what's possible in production environments. **These commands are not meant to be executed in this training** - they require additional setup and permissions typically managed by administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Row-Level Security (Reference Pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Restricts which rows users can see based on their identity or group membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use case:** Regional managers only see data for their region, while executives see all regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustrative SQL pattern** (do not run):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Step 1: Create a filter function that checks user permissions\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION your_catalog.your_schema.filter_by_region(region STRING)\n",
    "RETURN region IN (\n",
    "  SELECT region FROM your_catalog.your_schema.user_permissions \n",
    "  WHERE user_email = current_user()\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Step 2: Apply the filter to a table\n",
    "ALTER TABLE your_catalog.your_schema.sensor_data\n",
    "SET ROW FILTER your_catalog.your_schema.filter_by_region(region) ON (region);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** When any user queries `sensor_data`, they automatically only see rows for regions they're authorized to access. The filter is transparent to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Masking (Reference Pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Shows different column values based on user permissions, masking sensitive data for unauthorized users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use case:** Analysts see masked device IDs (`***1234`) while engineers with elevated permissions see full IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustrative SQL pattern** (do not run):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Step 1: Create masking function based on user role\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION your_catalog.your_schema.mask_device_id(device_id STRING)\n",
    "RETURN CASE \n",
    "  WHEN is_member('admin') THEN device_id\n",
    "  ELSE CONCAT('***', RIGHT(device_id, 4))\n",
    "END;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Step 2: Apply mask to a column\n",
    "ALTER TABLE your_catalog.your_schema.sensor_data\n",
    "ALTER COLUMN device_id\n",
    "SET MASK your_catalog.your_schema.mask_device_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Non-admin users automatically see masked device IDs (e.g., \"***1234\") in all queries, while admins see the full values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When You'd Use These Features\n",
    "\n",
    "These advanced security patterns are typically implemented by data governance teams in production environments when:\n",
    "- Compliance regulations require data access restrictions (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)\n",
    "- Different business units need access to the same tables but different rows\n",
    "- Sensitive data must be masked for certain user groups\n",
    "- Audit requirements mandate automatic, transparent security controls\n",

    "4. **Document your permission model** - Keep track of which groups have access to what\n",
