    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're working on your aircraft sensor analysis:\n",
    "- You make changes to your notebook\n",
    "- Something breaks\n",
    "- You can't remember what worked before\n",
    "- Your teammate also made changes and now there are conflicts\n",
    "- You want to go back to yesterday's version but it's gone\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version control** is like a \"time machine\" for your code. It:\n",
    "- **Tracks every change** you make to files\n",
    "- **Saves snapshots** of your work over time\n",
    "- **Allows collaboration** without overwriting each other's work\n",
    "- **Lets you undo** changes when something breaks\n",
    "- **Shows who changed what** and when\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is the most popular version control system. Think of it as:\n",
    "- A **history book** for your code\n",
    "- A **save point system** like in video games\n",
    "- A **collaboration tool** that merges everyone's work\n",

    "### Key Git Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | What It Means |\n",
    "|------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Repository (Repo)** | A folder that Git tracks - contains all your files and their history |\n",
    "| **Commit** | A snapshot of your work at a point in time (like hitting \"Save\" with a description) |\n",
    "| **Push** | Upload your changes from your computer to the shared repository |\n",
    "| **Pull** | Download changes from the shared repository to your computer |\n",
    "| **Branch** | A separate version of your code where you can experiment |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Your Aircraft IoT Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your notebooks, pipelines, and dashboards can be **versioned**\n",

    "## 3. Working with Git Folders: The Basic Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a typical workflow using your aircraft IoT project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario: Updating Your Temperature Analysis Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Pull Latest Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start working, **always pull** to get the latest changes from your team:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your Git folder\n",
    "2. Look for the **Git status indicator** in the top bar\n",
    "3. Click the **\"Pull\"** button (or the refresh/sync icon)\n",
    "4. Databricks downloads any changes your teammates made\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** If a teammate updated the same notebook, you'll get their latest version before making your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Make Your Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now work normally:\n",
    "- Edit notebooks\n",
    "- Add new files\n",
    "- Modify transformations\n",
    "- Test your code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** You update your aircraft engine temperature analysis to use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Check What Changed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the **Git status icon** (usually shows a number of changed files)\n",
    "2. You'll see a list of **modified files** with a \"M\" indicator\n",
    "3. You'll see **new files** with an \"A\" (added) indicator\n",
    "4. Click any file to see a **diff** (what changed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's a diff?**\n",
    "- Lines in **red** (with a `-`) were deleted\n",
    "- Lines in **green** (with a `+`) were added\n",
    "- Unchanged lines appear in gray\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Commit Your Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "A **commit** is like taking a snapshot with a description:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Git panel, click **\"Commit\"**\n",
    "2. Review the files that will be included\n",
    "3. Write a **commit message** describing what you changed:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Good: \"Convert engine temperature to Celsius for international standards\"\n",
    "   Bad: \"changes\" or \"update\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Click **\"Commit & Push\"** (or just \"Commit\" if you want to push later)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices for Commit Messages:**\n",
    "- Be specific: \"Add anomaly detection for altitude sensors\"\n",
    "- Explain why: \"Fix typo in column name causing join failure\"\n",
    "- Use present tense: \"Update\" not \"Updated\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Push Your Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only committed (didn't \"Commit & Push\"), you need to **push**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the **\"Push\"** button\n",
    "2. Your changes upload to Azure DevOps\n",
    "3. Now your teammates can pull and see your changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Happens When You Push?**\n",
    "- Your commits go to the **remote repository** (Azure DevOps)\n",
    "- The change history is preserved\n",
    "- Other team members can see your updates\n",

    "   <<<<<<< HEAD (your changes)\n",
    "   temperature_threshold = 150\n",
    "   =======\n",

    "5. Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)\n",
    "6. **Commit** the resolved version\n",
    "7. **Push** the merge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario B: You Want to Experiment Without Breaking Things\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use branches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your Git folder, click the **branch dropdown**\n",
    "2. Type a new branch name: `feature/new-anomaly-detection`\n",
    "3. Click **\"Create branch\"**\n",
    "4. You're now on a **separate copy** of the code\n",
    "5. Make experimental changes\n",
    "6. Commit and push to your branch\n",
    "7. If it works, **merge** it back to `main` later (usually through a Pull Request in Azure DevOps)\n",

    "- Click the file in the Git panel\n",
    "- Click **\"Discard changes\"** to revert to the last commit\n",
    "\n",
    "**After committing:**\n",

    "### Creating a Bundle in the Databricks UI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Access the Bundle Feature\n",

    "#### Step 3: Define Your Bundle Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The bundle editor can be opened by clicking the rocket ship icon on the left sidebar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll now configure your bundle to include the job you created on Day 1. This process demonstrates the fundamental concepts of automated deployment - how code-as-configuration enables repeatable, version-controlled deployments.\n",

    "- **Paste** the YAML you copied from your job\n",
    "- Click **\"Deploy\"** to deploy your job through the bundle\n",

    "**What you've learned:**\n",
    "- **Infrastructure as Code**: Job configurations defined in YAML files\n",
    "- **Version Control**: Bundle configurations stored in Git alongside your code\n",
    "- **Repeatable Deployment**: Deploy the same configuration to multiple environments\n",
    "- **Deployment Automation**: Foundation for automated deployment pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**In production environments**, these concepts enable fully automated workflows:\n",
    "1. Developer commits changes to a Git branch (e.g., `main`)\n",
    "2. CI/CD system (like Azure DevOps Pipelines) detects the commit\n",
    "3. Automated pipeline runs `databricks bundle deploy --target production`\n",
    "4. Your jobs, notebooks, and dashboards are automatically deployed to production\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're focusing on:** Understanding the building blocks of automated deployment - how configurations are defined, versioned, and deployed. Setting up the full CI/CD pipeline is typically a DevOps team responsibility and involves additional infrastructure beyond the scope of this training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:** Asset Bundles enable you to deploy your data and ML workflows consistently across environments, whether deployed manually (as in this exercise) or through automated CI/CD pipelines in production."

    "✅ **Do:**\n",
    "- Pull before you start working each day\n",
    "- Commit often with clear messages\n",
    "- Push at least once a day (or when you finish a feature)\n",
    "- Use branches for experimental work\n",
    "- Review diffs before committing\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't:**\n",
    "- Work for days without committing\n",
    "- Write vague commit messages (\"fixed stuff\")\n",
    "- Commit broken or untested code to `main`\n",
    "- Force push (overwrites others' work)\n",
    "- Commit sensitive data (passwords, API keys)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bundle Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Do:**\n",
    "- Validate before deploying\n",
    "- Test in development before production\n",
    "- Document what each bundle contains\n",
    "- Version your bundles (`v1`, `v2`, etc.)\n",
    "- Keep bundles focused (one project per bundle)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't:**\n",
    "- Deploy directly to production without testing\n",
    "- Include experimental or test notebooks\n",
    "- Bundle unrelated projects together\n",
    "- Forget to update bundle configs when you change notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**When working with your team:**\n",
    "1. **Communicate** - Let others know what files you're working on\n",
    "2. **Pull often** - Stay synced with team changes\n",
    "3. **Small commits** - Easier to review and merge\n",
    "4. **Document** - Add comments explaining complex logic\n",
